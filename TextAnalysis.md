# Text Analysis
The text analysis that I found was a really interesting digital humanities projected title **"6 Degrees of Francis Bacon"** which maps early modern social networks. 

**How was this created?**

[Here's a link to the site]([url](http://www.sixdegreesoffrancisbacon.com/?ids=10010748&min_confidence=60&type=network)http://www.sixdegreesoffrancisbacon.com/?ids=10010748&min_confidence=60&type=network) and [here is a link to the projects GitHub repository! ]([url](https://github.com/sdfb/sdfb)https://github.com/sdfb/sdfb)

Their analysis was created using a mix of tools. According to their repo, it is made up of a Ruby on Rails backend (a set of API endpoints that communicate with a Postgres database), and an AngularJS frontend. Ruby on Rails is an open-source framework builder, and Postgres is an open source data manager. AngularJS is the tool it looks like users see the most, and is a programming language. 

**What does this show us about data, and DH?**
