# Text Analysis
The text analysis that I found was a really interesting digital humanities projected title **"6 Degrees of Francis Bacon"** which maps early modern social networks. 

**How was this created?**

Here is the [site](http://www.sixdegreesoffrancisbacon.com/) and here is a link to the projects [GitHub repository!](https://github.com/sdfb/sdfb))

Their analysis was created using a mix of tools. According to their repo, it is made up of a Ruby on Rails backend (a set of API endpoints that communicate with a Postgres database), and an AngularJS frontend. Ruby on Rails is an open-source framework builder, and Postgres is an open source data manager. AngularJS is the tool it looks like users see the most, and is a programming language. 


**What does this show us about data, and DH?**

I think this tool shows us about how many different ways you can approach building a project, and how different frameworks work together. Because I'm not very familiar with building tools, I found it really interesting that so many different frameworks were a part of their project. In terms of DH, I think this project gives a really great sense of scale of how long humanities networks have been building.
