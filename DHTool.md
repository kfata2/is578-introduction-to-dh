# **Digital Humanities Tool Expoloration**

[StoryMap.JS](https://storymap.knightlab.com) is a digital humanities tool developed at KnightLab, which is a collaborative lab out of Northwestern University.

The purpose of StoryMap is to highlight the locations of a series of events through mapping and descriptions. 

I could not locate this in the Index of DH! So. . . 
_[Here](https://www.georgiahumanities.org/southern-literary-trail-story-map/)_ is a link to a project at Georgia Humanities that puts it to use! 

I became aware of this tool because I often use, or embed, DH tools at my full-time job, where I am a production editor for an open-access scholarly publishing platform. While I haven't used this tool specifically in my work, its often one that we throw around, as well as their Timeline.JS tool which maps stories into timelines! I think its a really strong DH tool because it is so user-friendly, and is easily applicable to a breadth of different projects.
