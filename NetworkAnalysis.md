# **Network Analysis**

I made a few networks with different tools using Melanie Walsh's dataset on W. E. B. Du Bois's _The Crisis_ in 1910, which can be found below:

**Network Navigator**

I found Network Navigator easy to use and loved all of the pointers for users like "Looking for definitions for these terms?" Seeing this immediately made me spend more time using the tool, because the documentation was so accessible. I could make networks and then immediately look through the terms to see what the relationships I was seeing between the nodes meant based on the visual cues I was being provided. Below, I've attached my network of authors published in _The Crisis_. I enjoyed comparing what weighted and unweighted filtering could do. I didn't immediately find anything especially interactive about my network in this tool besides being able to move it around and change colors, but I'm looking forward to adding this one to my toolbelt.
