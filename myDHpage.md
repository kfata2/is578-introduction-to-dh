# **Explanation**

Wow I had a great time with this assignment! I use CSS for work sometimes, but haven't really understood the innerworkings of it while using it, and mostly just used it to change fonts and colors. I used a combination of resources to complete this assignment. 

**Step One**

I started by just creating an HTML file. I used Visual Studio Code, which I found really intuitive, and definitely plan to continue using in the future.

Here's an example of what that looked like. I messed around for a while, but I thought a better way to get to know HTML would be to look around and try to customize code. 

**Step Two**

So I moved over to ChatGPT, where I asked _"Where can I find free CSS templates?_

That led me to [W3](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp). I picked out a template there, and was given the following code block: https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_webpage.htm

You can see there what the site originally looked like. 

**Step Three**

From there I used the resource we were given in class, https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_byfunc.asp, to customize the site. 

If you would like to try, almost everything is clickable and interactive. A few things go the wrong places, but I'm proud nonetheless! 

Here's a screenshot of my site! And [here is the site](
